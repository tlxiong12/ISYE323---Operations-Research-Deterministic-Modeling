# ISYE323---Operations-Research-Deterministic-Modeling


I used software called IJulia JuMP for this class. This course covered techniques for modeling and optimizing deterministic systems, emphasizing linear and integer programming. 
I learned to formulate real world decision problems as mathematical models and used computer based tools to solve them. Applications included production planning, logistics and supply chain optimization, 
and the design and improvement of service systems.
